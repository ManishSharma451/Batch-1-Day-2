
[A].   Array Methods In Javascript:-



1.)  Array.push() : Adding Element at the end of an Array. As array in JavaScript are mutable object, we can easily add or remove elements                             from the Array. And it dynamically changes as we modify the elements from the array.
               Syntax :
                               Array.push(item1, item2 …)
                               Parameters: Items to be added to an array.

2.)  Array.unshift() : Adding elements at the front of an Array
                  Syntax :
                               Array.unshift(item1, item2 …)
                               Parameters: Items to be added to the array

                  Syntax:
                             Array.splice (start, deleteCount, item 1, item 2….) 
                             Parameters:  
                                       Start : Location at which to perform operation
